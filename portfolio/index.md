# Portfolio

Welcome to my E-portfolio for ENGL 361 'Technical Writing'! My name is Daman
Morris; I am currently an undergraduate student at the Rochester Institute of
Technology. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate both what I have
learned this semester as part of the Technical Writing course, as well as my
prior academic work and personal writing (in the broadest sense possible,
including coding work) over the course of my undergraduate career.

This site is organized into several distinct sections:

- This page, which gives a broad overview
- The [about page](about), which presents some additional biographical
  information about me
- The [projects page](proj), which goes into detail about the projects I have
  undertaken as part of this course and other personal projects I have completed
  over the years
- The [reflection page](refl), which is a reflection of my personal experience
  of the course overall

You can also see a copy of my current [résumé](/resume.pdf).
